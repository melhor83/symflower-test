# Symflower Test Projekt

Simple test application for symflower

https://symflower.com/en/products/symflower-cli/#installation-tab-macos

run with

`symflower App.java`

## Pros
* Tests were really good in finding some edge cases for I/O!!
* Once set-up correctly, generating tests is pretty easy. 

## Cons
* Import Handling is disabled - i had to write everything by my own.
* I was missing some more meaningful tests for inputs between 0 - UPPER_LIMIT to check against fibonacci series
* custom output name of test class?
